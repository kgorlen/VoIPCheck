# VoIPCheck

**voipcheck** - Check Cisco ATA 191 VoIP adapter status.

# SYNOPSIS

```voipcheck```

# DESCRIPTION

The **voipcheck** CLI tool checks the status of a Rath 2100-VOIP2CS (a.k.a Cisco
191 ATA) VoIP adapter and sends pings to `healthchecks.io`.

**voipcheck** also writes a log file named **voipcheck.log** to the conventional
OS-dependent log directory, `C:\Users\`*`Username`*`\AppData\Local\VoIPCheck\Logs`
on Windows.

# OPTIONS

None.

# **voipcheck** SETTINGS

Settings for **voipcheck** are configured in the `voipcheck.toml` file in the
conventional OS-dependent data directory,
`C:\Users\`*`Username`*`\AppData\Roaming\VoIPCheck` on Windows.

See [TOML: A config file format for humans](https://toml.io/en/) for the
**.toml** file format specification.
